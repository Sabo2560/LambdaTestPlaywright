# Test Plan: LambdaTest E-commerce Playground

## 1. Test Scope and Objectives

### Scope
This test plan covers the UI and API testing of the LambdaTest E-commerce Playground application. The scope includes the following key functionalities:
- User Registration and Authentication
- Product Browsing and Searching
- Shopping Cart and Wishlist Management
- Checkout and Order Placement
- API endpoints for core functionalities

### Objectives
- To ensure the application's critical user flows are functioning as expected.
- To identify and document bugs and defects in the application.
- To create a maintainable and scalable automated test suite.
- To prepare the test suite for future CI/CD integration.

## 2. Test Approach
A hybrid testing approach will be adopted, with a primary focus on automated testing using Playwright. Manual testing will be performed for exploratory testing and to identify test cases for automation.

- **Automated Testing:** Playwright with TypeScript will be used for both UI and API testing. The Page Object Model (POM) will be used for UI tests to ensure code reusability and maintainability.
- **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing will be conducted to discover edge cases and usability issues.

## 3. Test Environment Requirements
- **Node.js:** v16 or higher
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (as supported by Playwright)
- **Operating System:** Any OS that supports Node.js and Playwright (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 4. Test Cases for Critical User Flows

| Test Case ID | Description | Type | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC01 | A registered user can successfully log in. | Positive | High |
| TC02 | A user cannot log in with invalid credentials. | Negative | High |
| TC03 | A user can search for a product and see relevant results. | Positive | High |
| TC04 | A user sees a "no results" message when searching for a non-existent product. | Negative | Medium |
| TC05 | A user can add a product to the cart. | Positive | High |
| TC06 | A user can navigate to the cart and see the added product. | Positive | High |
| TC07 | A user can proceed to checkout. | Positive | High |
| TC08 | A user cannot proceed to checkout with an empty cart. | Negative | Medium |
| TC09 | A user can complete the checkout process. | Positive | High |
| TC10 | (API) The `/api/products` endpoint returns a list of products. | Positive | High |
| TC11 | A new user can successfully register an account. | Positive | High |
| TC12 | A user cannot register with an existing email address. | Negative | High |

## 5. Risk Assessment and Prioritization

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Third-party payment gateway failure | Medium | High | Mock the payment gateway API in tests. |
| Inconsistent test data | High | Medium | Use a dedicated test data management strategy. |
| Complex UI components | Medium | Medium | Use robust locators and assertions in tests. |

Tests will be prioritized based on business impact and risk. High-priority test cases will be automated first.

## 6. Defect Reporting Procedure
Bugs will be documented in a `BUG_REPORTS.md` file in the repository. Each bug report will include:
- A unique ID
- A descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Screenshots or logs, if applicable
